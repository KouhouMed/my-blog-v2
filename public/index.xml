      <description>What is Data Engineering? Data Engineering is a relatively new field in data-related topics. When we are talking about data folks, we usually think about two types of responsibilities inside the team:&#xA;those who analyze the data those who prepare the data for analysis In the first category there are Data Analysts, Data Scientist, Data Visualization specialists, Product Analysts, etc.&#xA;In the second category there are more technical people: Data Engineers, BI developers, DevOps/DataOps.</description>

      <description>Building a Real-Time Stock Market Data Pipeline with Apache Kafka and Cassandra In today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced financial markets, the ability to process and analyze real-time data is crucial. I recently embarked on a project to build a real-time stock market data pipeline using Apache Kafka and Cassandra. This project not only enhanced my understanding of distributed systems but also provided valuable insights into handling high-volume, time-sensitive data.&#xA;Project Overview The goal was to create a system that could:</description>

      <description>Unveiling Market Insights: My CAPM Stock Analysis App In the ever-evolving world of finance, making informed investment decisions is crucial. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share a tool I&amp;rsquo;ve developed that brings the power of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to your fingertips: the CAPM Stock Analysis App.&#xA;What is CAPM? Before diving into the app, let&amp;rsquo;s briefly discuss CAPM. The Capital Asset Pricing Model is a fundamental concept in modern financial theory.</description>

      <description>In a previous article, we have explained the principles of K-Nearest Neighbours and Decision Trees and seen hands-on examples of how these models can be created using R programming language. In this article, we will continue on the same track and see other supervised learning algorithms, namely Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.&#xA;Regression is one of the most important fields in statistics and machine learning. Its objective is to find relationships between variables.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier post, machine learning algorithms are categorized into three main types :&#xA;Supervised learning algorithms Unsupervised learning algorithms Reinfocement learning algorithms In this article, we will only talk about some of machine learning supervised algorithms. We&amp;rsquo;ll also see examples using R programming language.&#xA;First of all, I would like to remind you that supervised learning is a machine learning algorithm that tries to find a function mapping an input to a given output based on a set of examples.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What we want is a machine that can learn from experience&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Alan Turing, 1947&#xA;What is machine learning ? Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows a system to learn from data without explicitly programming the instructions to be executed. However, machine learning is not a simple process. As the algorithms ingest the training data, it becomes possible to create more accurate models based on that data.</description>

      <description>“You can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data.” – Daniel Keys Moran&#xA;Data science is one of the most debated topics in the industries these days. Its popularity has grown over the years, and companies have started implementing data science techniques to grow their business and increase customer satisfaction. According to a study conducted in 2013, 90% of the world&amp;rsquo;s data has been produced within the previous two years.</description>
